# Bachelor-Project-NUC

This project provides the following:

1. Security data corpus including the 10 different security log file we have tested.
2. Five BASH script - final version is updated 
3. Datasheet 

Security data corpus
1. accesslog.log
2. apachelog.log
3. connectionlog
4. csvhoneypots
5. fileslog.log
6. honeypots.json
7. httplog.log
8. mawitraffic.pcap
9. phishingemail.csv
10. snortlog.pcap

BASH script
1. compress-decompress-7z.sh
2. compress-decompress-bzip2.sh
3. compress-decompress-gzip.sh
4. compress-decompress-lz4.sh
5. compress-decompress-zip.sh

Datasheet with statistical data
1. Stat-Summary_FINAL_28.04.2024.xlsx

The security data files are final as well as the datasheet. The five BASH scripts have slightly
been improved along our experiment. The easiest way to execute the script is to place the
same directory as the security data corpus is, alternatively follow the instructions:

1. Create a testing directory with mkdir directory_name command.
2. Copy the script into the testing directory.
3. Open the script with sudo nano file_name command.
4. Modify the execution path where the security data corpus is located and save the file
by CTRL+X.
5. Run the script on the command line.
